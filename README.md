## Inspiration and Code Credits

I took inspiration and code credit from two different youtubers. The first is Tahmid Ahmed. He went through creating a full portfolio website. I used his code to help with my header, icons, and buttons. The video is linked here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgeoAUvoRJU

I also took inspiration from CodeHal to help with my navigation and sections. The video is linked here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoE1hqfpXX0

Aditionally I used W3 school to help with positioning and buttons (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp)
